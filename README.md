React Router Course Project
========

#### This is the repository for the project we'll build together during TylerMcGinnis.com's "React Router" course, for more information on the course see [tylermcginnis.com/courses](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses)

## You can see the final project [here](https://q9o4513nr4.codesandbox.io/)

The main idea of this app is you have a league of teams and you can view information about each team like roster, articles, etc.

## Notes
Every video is coincided with a branch. If you want to compare your code with mine or you just want to play around with the code, check out the different branches on this repository.
